# Bank Holiday work

## 1. Sparta University
##### This uses the Python exercise given during Python Development week to demonstrate the 4 pillars of OOP in action. 
It is comprised of 4 files: person.py, student.py, modules.py and batch.py. The latter file brings together all of the components together via multilevel inheritance. The test.py file uses the unittest library to check that the methods created in all the classes work correctly.

## 2. Data Cleaning
##### This shows the code created to clean the dataset used for a Tableau project
The Investors worksheet required cleaning to so that there was only one column with the unique values. For the purpose of this work and to demonstrate the use of the xlsx library, the cleaned data is inserted into a new workbook.
